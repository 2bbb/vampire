The CASC modes are semi-automatically constructed as a list of good strategies, divided into classes.

Each strategy is either Forked or Spawned as a new proces (see ForkingCM and SpawningCM) and the time is sliced between strategies. Forking is used in linux-based systems, spawning in Windows.

CASCMode.cpp		Implements standard CASC mode and the sat and epr versions
CASCMode.hpp
CLTBMode.cpp		Implements CASC mode for LTB i.e. batch processing
CLTBMode.hpp
CMZRMode.cpp		Also batch processing
CMZRMode.hpp
ForkingCM.cpp		Runs slice in a forked process
ForkingCM.hpp
SpawningCM.cpp		Runs slice in a spawned process (warning, this mode will not preserve additional options)
SpawningCM.hpp
