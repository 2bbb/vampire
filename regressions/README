Directory containing scripts for regression testing of Vampire

There are two kinds of regressions:
1) Scripts that do a check and exit with non-zero status if something went wrong
  -- these scripts are in the "scripts" subdirectory
2) Problems on which Vampire should be run
  -- the default test here is that Vampire should not crash, but other tests
     (as well as command line arguments for Vampire) may be specified in the
     problem files using special tags
